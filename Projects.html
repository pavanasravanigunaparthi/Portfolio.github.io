    <h1>MISSING CHILD IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM USING <br> DEEP LEARNING AND MULTICLASS SVM</h1>
    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>This project presents a novel use of deep learning methodology for identifying the reported missing child from the photos of 
       multitude of children available, with the help of face recognition. The public can upload photographs of suspicious child into 
       a common portal with landmarks and remarks. The photo will be automatically compared with the registered photos of the missing 
       child from the repository. Classification of the input child image is performed and photo with best match will be selected from 
       the database of missing children. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a highly effective deep learning technique for image 
       based applications is adopted here for face recognition. Face descriptors are extracted from the images using a pre-trained CNN 
       model VGG-Face deep architecture. Compared with normal deep learning applications, our algorithm uses convolution network only as 
       a high level feature extractor and the child recognition is done by the trained SVM classifier.</p>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Children are the greatest asset of each nation. The future of any country depends upon the right upbringing of its children.
       India is the second populous country in the world and children represent a significant percentage of total population. 
       But unfortunately a large number of children go missing every year in India due to various reasons including abduction or
       kidnapping, run-away children, trafficked children and lost children. A deeply disturbing fact about India's missing children 
       is that while on an average 173 children go missing every day, half of them remain untraced.Mostly missing child cases are 
       reported to the police.<br>
       The child missing from one region may be found in another region or another state, for various reasons. 
       So even if a child is found, it is difficult to identify him/her from the reported missing cases. A framework and methodology 
       for developing an assistive tool for tracing missing child is described in this paper. An idea for maintaining a virtual space 
       is proposed, such that the recent photographs of children given by parents at the time of reporting missing cases is saved in a 
       repository.<br> 
       The public is given provision to voluntarily take photographs of children in suspected situations and uploaded in 
       that portal. Automatic searching of this photo among the missing child case images will be provided in the application.

       <h2>SCOPE</h2>
       <p>
        In India a countless number of children are reported missing every year. Among the missing child cases a large percentage of 
        children remain untraced.The public can upload photographs of suspicious child into a common portal with landmarks and remarks.
        The photo will be automatically compared with the registered photos of the missing child from the repository.The Convolutional 
        Neural Network (CNN), a highly effective deep learning technique for image based applications is adopted here for face recognition.

      <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      <p>A missing child identification system is proposed, which combines the powerful CNN based deep learning approach for feature 
        extraction and support vector machine classifier for classification of different child categories. This system is evaluated 
        with the deep learning model which is trained with feature representations of children faces. By discarding thesoftmax of the 
        VGG-Face model and extracting CNN image features to train a multi class SVM, it was possible to achieve superior performance. 
        Performance of the proposed system is tested using the photographs of children with different lighting conditions, noises and 
        also images at different ages of children. The classification achieved a higher accuracy of 99.31% which shows that the proposed
        methodology of face recognition could be used for reliable missing children identification.
